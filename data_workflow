RealResearch proteomics collaboration data processing workflow

FASTA databases
1. Downloaded SwissProt+Tremble human and murine
2. FASTA to tabular in Galaxy
3. Murine and human protein databases were merged and filtered for non-redundant sequences
4. fbs and common contams were added and filtered for non-redundant sequences
5. iRTs sequence was added
6. Tabular to FASTA and width conversion - Galaxy

Raw files
1. DDA library creation from DDA files - Fragpipe
2. Umpire library creation from DIA files - Fragpipe
3. Conversion of DIA to DIANN format - mzml dia
4. Library creation de novo from deep-learning networks - DIANN
5. Alingment of libraries - Artur's python script
6. Quantitation in DIANN to create one merged lib creation
7. Library filtered to only human precursor peptides
8. Quantitation in DIANN using automatic mass shift tolerance
9. Quantitation in DIANN using defined mass shift tolerances

TSV matrix - MSqRob processing
1.

Quantitation matrix - R
1. Tidying up
2. Normalization methods performance â€“ proBacth/LIMMA
3. Quantile normalization - proBATCH
4. Differential expression - LIMMA
5. GO and KEGG GSEA - clusterProfiler
6. ANOVA filtering and its effect on clustering and GSEA
